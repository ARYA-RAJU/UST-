	<h2 id="topic1">Websites</h2>
	<p>We know that a website is a collection of a webpages hosted on a web-server. These are the components for making a website.
        Components of a Website: 
		Webhost: Hosting is the location where the website is physically located. Group of webpages (linked webpages) licensed to be called a website only when the webpage is hosted on the webserver. The webserver is a set of files transmitted to user computers when they specify the website’s address..
		Address: Address of a website also known as the URL of a website. When a user wants to open a website then they need to put the address or URL of the website into the web browser, and the asked website is delivered by the webserver.
		Homepage : Home page is a very common and important part of a webpage. It is the first webpage that appears when a visitor visits the website. The home page of a website is very important as it sets the look and feel of the website and directs viewers to the rest of the pages on the website.
		Design : It is the final and overall look and feel of the website that has a result of proper use and integration elements like navigation menus, graphics, layout, navigation menus etc.
		Content : Every web pages contained on the website together make up the content of the website. Good content on the webpages makes the website more effective and attractive.
		The Navigation Structure: The navigation structure of a website is the order of the pages, the collection of what links to what. Usually, it is held together by at least one navigation menu.
		How to access Websites?
		When we type a certain URL in a browser search bar, the browser requests the page from the Web server and the Web server returns the required web page and its content to the browser. Now, it differs from how the server returns the information required in the case of static and dynamic websites.</p>
	

	<h2 id="topic2">Smart Phones</h2>
	<p>Mobile technology is a type of technology in which a user utilizes a mobile phone to perform communications-related tasks, such as communicating with friends, relatives, and others. It is used to send data from one system to another. Portable two-way communications systems, computing devices, and accompanying networking equipment make up mobile technology.
		Mobile technology is largely employed in cellular communication systems and other related areas. It employs a network architecture that allows multiple transmitters to deliver data on a single channel at the same time. Because it reduces the potential of frequency interference from two or more sources, this platform allows multiple users to use single frequencies. The channel has evolved over time.
		This is fast expanding; its applications are getting increasingly broad over time, and it is gradually replacing other similar sources of communication on the market, such as post offices and landlines. Mobile technology has progressed from a simple phone and texting device to a multi-tasking system that can be used for GPS navigation, internet browsing, gaming, and instant messaging, among other things. With the rise, experts claim that the future of computer technology is dependent on wireless networking and mobile computing.
				Through tablets and small PCs, mobile technology is becoming increasingly popular. This smartphone system has since been improved to a big multitasking computer that can be used for GPS navigation, gaming, internet browsing, and instant messaging. Tablets and portable laptops have increased the adoption of mobile technology. The mobile networks that connect these devices are referred to as wireless systems. They allow speech, data, and (mobile) apps to be shared between mobile devices</p>
	

	<h2 id="topic3">Digital Television</h2>
	<p>Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of television signals using a digital broadcast format rather than conventional analog methods.
		In the United States, analog television broadcasts stopped in 2009 and people who had used antennas for "over the air" transmission were required to use a digital set-top box to convert transmissions. Today, with the growing affordability of digital televisions, most analog television sets have been replaced.
		How does DTV work?
		Digital television uses digital compression to convert digital signals into digital packets of data, which are then transmitted over the air or via cable or satellite.
		The digital signal can be received by a digital TV antenna, cable box or satellite receiver -- depending on the type of service being used. The digital signal is decoded and converted back into an analog form before it is displayed on the viewer's screen.</p>
	    What are the benefits of DTV?
		Compared to analog television, DTV offers improved picture quality, multiple channels of programming on the same frequency, special features such as digital video recording (DVR) capabilities and interactive features like digital program guides (EPGs).
		For broadcasters, DTV uses digital compression which reduces the amount of bandwidth required for transmission, making it more efficient and allowing for high-definition broadcasts. It also enables broadcasters to add digital subchannels, which gives viewers access to additional programming options.
		With digital television, there are often multiple channels of the same broadcaster available on one frequency. For example, with digital multicasting, a single broadcast station will be able to transmit multiple standard and high-definition digital channels simultaneously.</p>
	

	<h2 id="topic4">eBooks</h2>
	<p>e-book, in full electronic book, digital file containing a body of text and images suitable for distributing electronically and displaying on-screen in a manner similar to a printed book. E-books can be created by converting a printer’s source files to formats optimized for easy downloading and on-screen reading, or they can be drawn from a database or a set of text files that were not created solely for print.
	   The industry for buying and selling e-books first emerged as a mainstream business in the late 1990s, when companies like Peanut Press began selling book content for reading on personal digital assistants (PDAs), handheld devices that were the predecessors of today’s smartphones and tablet computers. However, in the aftermath of the dot-com crash of 2000–2002, e-books did not find wide acceptance by the publishing industry, and investment in e-reading devices and e-book technologies subsided. The industry’s resurgence may have begun when the Sony Corporation released an e-reading device in 2006 and Amazon.com released the Kindle in 2007, after which sales of e-books in the United States grew rapidly.		How e-books are distributed
		E-books are usually distributed on the Internet as downloadable files that can be read offline, as live Web pages that must be read online, or as Web pages that are cached by a Web browser for reading offline.
		The source of the catalog or metadata (which is data about the data) for a file may be entirely distinct from the source of the file itself. In other words, customers might find, read about, and buy e-books on a retailer’s Web site, but, when they purchase the e-books, they will download the files directly from the publisher’s or distributor’s servers, which may be on the other side of the world. (The same applies to e-books in a public or institutional library). This distinction is hidden from the customer, but for businesses it is very significant. It allows for e-book files to be stored and managed in only one place (or very few places), even though customers may find them listed for sale or loan in any number of places. Without this distinction, all e-book distribution would occur within closed, proprietary systems, where e-book buyers or library patrons would have to get their books directly from a small number of owners of e-book files.</p>

	<h2 id="topic5">Blogs</h2>
	<p>A blog (short for “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website run by an individual, group, or corporation that offers regularly updated content (blog post) about a topic. It presents information in reverse chronological order and it’s written in an informal or conversational style.</p>
	If you plan to create your own blog, it is helpful to know what makes an excellent one in the first place. Typically, you can expect to find the following elements in successful blogs:

	High-quality blog content. The content should demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (EAT). It is also important to use easy-to-understand language and formatting to make the blog post digestible.
	Inviting headlines. These reveal what the content is about and help attract visitors to the content, as around 80% of people will click search engine results if the headlines are compelling.
	Regularly-updated content. A regular publishing schedule helps people know when to visit the blog for new content. Search engines also prioritize fresh and up-to-date content, helping increase rankings and website traffic.
